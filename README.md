Project in-progress.

Analysis of League of Legends champion/role win rates (WRs) and League PhD (https://leaguephd.com/en/stats/) "first-pick scores" (FPSs).
FPSs are determined by AI-analysis of League of Legends parameters, including champion risk, synergy, and WR (see https://leaguephd.com/en/blog/which-champions-are-good-first-picks/).
FPSs are patch-dependent.
Data used to generate FPSs are role-based champion statistics, including frequency and WR.
Data derives from ranked solo-queue games from all servers for a particular patch.

Dependencies: scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib
